Speak to Site
-------------

A chrome extension that allows you to use a context menu drop down on any editable input (input, textarea, etc) to flip the "speech" attribute which tells the browser that you can do speech-to-text conversion.

For a full sample see:

* NOTE: The Context Menu API *

I was shocked that the context menu API in Chrome (http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/beta/contextMenus.html as of Sept 27th 2010) didn't pass you the DOM element of the editable element.

Fortunately, antimatter15 (he is 15!) had the nice hack:
